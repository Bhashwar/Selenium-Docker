/*
Explanation of Key Concepts:
Package: A folder structure to organize code. Think of it like a drawer in a filing cabinet.

Import: Bringing in tools or code from other places so you can use them in your program.

Class: A blueprint for creating objects. It contains methods (functions) and variables.

Logger: A tool to record messages, like errors or information, to help debug or track whatâ€™s happening in the program.

ObjectMapper: A tool that converts JSON (a text format for data) into Java objects (code-friendly data).

Method: A block of code that performs a specific task. Here, getTestData reads JSON and converts it.

Try-Catch: A way to handle errors. The program tries to do something, and if it fails, it "catches" the error and handles it.

InputStream: A tool to read data from a file or resource.

Return: Sends a result back from a method. If something goes wrong, it returns null (nothing).

JSON: A simple text format for storing and exchanging data, like a list of settings or test data.

This code is used to read a JSON file, convert it into a Java object, and handle any errors that might occur during the process.
